## Granular data points

Use `getHealthDataFromTypes` to fetch individual points between two timestamps.

```dart
final points = await health.getHealthDataFromTypes(
  types: [
    HealthDataType.HEART_RATE,
    HealthDataType.STEPS,
  ],
  startTime: start,
  endTime: end,
  // Optional: filter out entries by recording method
  recordingMethodsToFilter: const [
    // RecordingMethod.manual,
  ],
  // Optional: request a specific unit per type
  preferredUnits: {
    HealthDataType.HEIGHT: HealthDataUnit.METER,
  },
);
```

Notes

- Some types will normalize their value (e.g., sleep/headache types convert to minutes based on the time interval).
- On Android, BMI values are computed by the plugin using the latest weight and height if requested.

## Interval (bucketed) data

Use `getHealthIntervalDataFromTypes` to aggregate into fixed-length buckets (e.g., daily sums or averages as defined by the native APIs):

```dart
final buckets = await health.getHealthIntervalDataFromTypes(
  startDate: DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(days: 7)),
  endDate: DateTime.now(),
  types: [HealthDataType.BLOOD_OXYGEN, HealthDataType.STEPS],
  interval: 86400, // seconds (1 day)
);
```

## Aggregate data (multi-type)

Use `getHealthAggregateDataFromTypes` for aggregate summaries across multiple types in one call (e.g., workouts summary data). You can control whether manual entries are included and the activity segment duration.

```dart
final aggregates = await health.getHealthAggregateDataFromTypes(
  types: [
    HealthDataType.WORKOUT,
    HealthDataType.TOTAL_CALORIES_BURNED,
  ],
  startDate: start,
  endDate: end,
  activitySegmentDuration: 1, // minutes
  includeManualEntry: true,
);
```

## Fetch by UUID (iOS only)

Fetch a single `HealthDataPoint` by its UUID and type. Returns `null` if not found.

```dart
final dp = await health.getHealthDataByUUID(
  uuid: '<record-uuid>',
  type: HealthDataType.WORKOUT,
);
```

## Duplicates

The plugin removes duplicate points using a `LinkedHashSet`. You can also call `removeDuplicates(points)` on your own lists.

## Recording method

Each `HealthDataPoint` has a `recordingMethod`:

- `automatic`, `manual`, `active`, or `unknown`
- On iOS, only `automatic` or `manual` are valid for writes; reads map to those as available.
- On Android, all four may be present based on Health Connect metadata.
