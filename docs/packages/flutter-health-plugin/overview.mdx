    **Flexible Data Queries**
    - Read individual data points
    - Get time-bucketed aggregates (hourly, daily, weekly)
    - Fetch workout summaries
    - Calculate step totals
    
    ```dart
    // Get last 24 hours of step data
    final data = await health.getHealthDataFromTypes(
      types: [HealthDataType.STEPS],
      startDate: yesterday,
      endDate: now,
    );
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Writing Data">
    <Icon icon="pen-to-square" size={32} />
    
    **Easy Data Recording**
    - Write numeric health data
    - Save workout sessions
    - Log meals with nutrition info
    - Record specialized data (ECG, audiograms, etc.)
    
    ```dart
    // Save weight measurement
    await health.writeHealthData(
      value: 70.5,
      type: HealthDataType.WEIGHT,
      startTime: DateTime.now(),
    );
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Permissions">
    <Icon icon="shield-halved" size={32} />
    
    **Permission Management**
    - Request granular permissions
    - Check permission status
    - Handle read/write access separately
    - Platform-specific permission flows
    
    ```dart
    // Request read access
    final granted = await health.requestAuthorization(
      [HealthDataType.STEPS],
      permissions: [HealthDataAccess.READ],
    );
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

final types = [HealthDataType.STEPS];
final granted = await health.requestAuthorization(types);

if (granted) {
  // 3. Read today's steps
  final now = DateTime.now();
  final midnight = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day);
  final steps = await health.getTotalStepsInInterval(midnight, now);
  
  print('Steps today: ${steps ?? 0}');
