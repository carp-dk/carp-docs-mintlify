# Data Types & Units

Types are defined in the `HealthDataType` enum with a default `HealthDataUnit` per type.

## Platform Availability

- **iOS** supports HealthKit-specific types such as workouts, ECG, sleep stages, nutrition, and many biometrics.
- **Android** supports Health Connect types including steps, heart rate, sleep, speed/distance, nutrition, hydration, menstruation flow, and more.

The plugin exposes two convenience lists:

```dart
// iOS
const List<HealthDataType> dataTypesIOS = [...];

// Android
const List<HealthDataType> dataTypesAndroid = [...];
```

Use them for quick testing or to build permission requests.

## Complete Data Types Reference

The following table shows all supported health data types, their units, and platform availability:

## Units

Each type maps to a default unit via `dataTypeToUnit` (e.g., `HEART_RATE` → `BEATS_PER_MINUTE`, `WEIGHT` → `KILOGRAM`). On reads you can optionally request a preferred unit per type.

```dart
final unit = dataTypeToUnit[HealthDataType.HEART_RATE]; // BEATS_PER_MINUTE
```

## Sleep & Headache Categories

For sleep and headache categorical types, values are converted to minutes based on the `dateFrom`/`dateTo` interval.

## Workouts

Workouts are represented as `HealthDataType.WORKOUT` with a `WorkoutHealthValue` that may include:

- `workoutActivityType`
- `totalEnergyBurned` (+ unit)
- `totalDistance` (+ unit)
- `totalSteps` (+ unit)

An additional `workoutSummary` is attached when available.

## Special Data

- **ECG** (`ELECTROCARDIOGRAM`) parses voltage series, average heart rate, sampling frequency, and classification.
- **Nutrition** (`NUTRITION`) supports a wide set of macro/micronutrients.
- **Menstruation flow** (`MENSTRUATION_FLOW`) normalizes platform-specific values.
