The plugin uses Apple HealthKit on iOS. In your Xcode project (Runner):

- Targets → Runner → Signing & Capabilities → add ``HealthKit''.

## Info.plist usage descriptions

Add the following keys with your user-facing rationale:

```xml
<!-- ios/Runner/Info.plist -->
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
```

## Permissions

On iOS, certain types only support READ (e.g., ECG events). The plugin will throw if you request WRITE for these.

- Examples that cannot be written: `ELECTROCARDIOGRAM`, heart-rate event types (high/low/irregular), `WALKING_HEART_RATE`, `ATRIAL_FIBRILLATION_BURDEN`.
- `recordingMethod` must be `manual` or `automatic` when writing.

## Special types

- Audiogram can be written on iOS only.
- Insulin delivery can be written on iOS only (requires a valid reason: basal or bolus).

Refer to the [Writing data](write-data) page for examples.
